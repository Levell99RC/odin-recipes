    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Learn how to make an all-American classic: the cheeseburger. There's never a wrong time for one!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Potato buns</li>
            <li>Ground beef. Make sure it has at least 20% fat content.</li>
            <li>Butterleaf lettuce</li>
            <li>A large, beefsteak tomato</li>
            <li>A red onion</li>
            <li>A slice of your favorite cheese (I will be using cheddar)</li>
            <li>Pickle slices</li>
            <li>Condiments of your choosing (I'll be using ketchup)</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove 2 leaves of butterleaf lettuce and clean.</li>
        <li>Cut a thick slice of tomato and lightly salt it.</li>
        <li>Thinly slices rings or strips of red onion.</li>
        <li>Take ground beef and shape into patty. I recommend making it larger than the bun and about 1/2 in thick.</li>
        <li>Set pan on medium and toast the buns.</li>
        <li>Remove the buns once done and raise the heat to high. Add in some oil.</li>
        <li>While the pan gets hot, add sauce to both buns. Stack lettuce, onion, and tomato on bottom bun (in that order).</li>
        <li>Once the pan is hot, lay the patty in. Season with salt and pepper on the exposed side.</li>
        <li>After roughly 3 minutes, flip and season the other side. Top with cheese slice to melt.</li>
        <li>After another 3 minutes, remove and either rest to lose some excess juice or place on sandwich.</li>
        <li>Top the patty with the pickles and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
