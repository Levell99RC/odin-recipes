    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>A deliciously seared, butter-basted, garlicy, herby, medium rare steak cooked to perfection.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A thick (&gt;; 1.5 in thick) ribeye or sirlion/NY steak</li>
        <li>2 tbsp of butter (salted or unsalted)</li>
        <li>3 cloves of garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>A sprig of rosemary</li>
        <li>A spring of thyme</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>A thermometer to test for perfect doneness</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>At least 45 min before cooking the steak, generously season the 
            steak with salt on both sides and leave in refrigerator, uncovered.</li>
        <li>When it's time to cook, preheat a cast iron or stainless steel pan on high with some oil.</li>
        <li>Once the smoke is lightly smoking, add in the steak. Make sure to lay away to avoid oil splatter.</li>
        <li>Flip once every minute.</li>
        <li>After two minutes, add the butter, garlic, thyme, and rosemary to the pan.</li>
        <li>Begin basting the steak with the infused butter and oil. Keep flipping.</li>
        <li>Begin testing with the thermometer after 4 minutes. 120F - 125F for rare. 125F - 130F for medium rare.
            130F - 135F for medium. 135F-140F for medium well. 140F+ for well done. If cooking a 
            thick cut steak, pull off the pan a few degrees off desired doneness as carry-over cooking will
            finish it.
        </li>
        <li>Take it out of the pan and let rest for 5 minutes. Pour over the oil and butter from the pan.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
